**** Some recommendations for better coding practices ****

Just to re-iterate, things we look for in code

1. clear and good object modeling 

2. clear and logical separation of responsibilities - (emphasis on single responsibility)

3. things not dumped in at one place 

4. Unit tests

5. easy to understand , not to complex code (something which can be extended by any other person)
   and ofcourse functional completion. 

Good luck!
